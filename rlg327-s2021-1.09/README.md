The features we implemented this assignment are, when you travel further down the dungeon the monster will get harder.
For combat we added ranged weapons, when equped you can press r to select a cell to make an attack on, there are two types of ranged weapons AOE and non-AOE the ranged weapons can also miss.
We also added a final boss on level 5, which implements a brand new combat system where you have to dodge missiles in order to win.
